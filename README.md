## Description

Using Monte Carlo simulation method, this "sampleMplus" package can explore the least sample size for your structural equation models.

The least sample size is chosen based on the following criteria:

For structural coefficients :

1. power â‰¥ 0.8;
2. biases of point estimates do not exceed 10%;
3. coverage rates of the frequentist confidence intervals or the Bayesian credible intervals is large than 0.91.



## Installation

You can install it  from github using Hadley Wickham's 'devtools' package. 

```r
install.packages("devtools")
library(devtools)

install_github("zhanglj37/sampleMplus")
```


## Example 1: Latent Mediation Analysis

```r
library(samplelm)

example model: https://www.lijinzhang.xyz/images/samplelm.jpg

# the effect size you should provide: loadings, structural coefficients
ly_matrix = matrix(c(
  1,0,0,
  0.8,0,0,
  0.8,0,0,
  0,1,0,
  0,0.8,0,
  0,0.8,0,
  0,0,1,
  0,0,0.8,
  0,0,0.8,
  0,0,0.8
),ncol=3,byr=T)
# the loading matrix
# the first-third column: the loadings for X, M, Y
# if you define the first loading of latent variable as 1, the fixed loading method would be used for model identification. 
# Otherwise, the fixed variance method would be applied.

latentvar = c("X", "M", "Y")
model = '
Y ON X*0.3
	M*0.2
M ON X* 0.3;'
# define the model in Mplus synatx
# define the effect size using*

estimator = "ML" # or Bayes


samplelm(ly_matrix, latentvar, model, estimator, n0 = 150)


# n0: the least sample size this function return

# or choose the sample just base on the power criteria (criteria 1)
samplePower(ly_matrix, latentvar, model, estimator, n0 = 150)
```

Running process:

(1) Increase the sample size by 5 at a time, and check whether the increased sample size meets the power criteria. If it meets the criteria, terminate the increase: 

```r
Running model: sample.inp 
System command: C:\WINDOWS\system32\cmd.exe /c cd "." && "Mplus" "sample.inp" 
Reading model:  sample.out 
[1] "This model needs at least 150 samples to reach a power of 0.598"

Running model: sample.inp 
System command: C:\WINDOWS\system32\cmd.exe /c cd "." && "Mplus" "sample.inp" 
Reading model:  sample.out 
[1] "This model needs at least 155 samples to reach a power of 0.652"

......

Running model: sample.inp 
System command: C:\WINDOWS\system32\cmd.exe /c cd "." && "Mplus" "sample.inp" 
Reading model:  sample.out 
[1] "This model needs at least 190 samples to reach a power of 0.804"
[1] "try the sample size: 190"
```

(2) Increase the sample size by 5 at a time, and check whether the increased sample size meets the criteria 2 - 3

```r
[1] "try the sample size: 190"

Running model: sample.inp 
System command: C:\WINDOWS\system32\cmd.exe /c cd "." && "Mplus" "sample.inp" 
Reading model:  sample.out 
$bias_violation
integer(0)

$coverage_violation
integer(0)

## Interpretation:
## criteria 2 & 3 are satisfied
## the least sample size is 190

```

## Example 2: Moderated Mediation Analysis

```r
library(samplelm)

example model: https://www.lijinzhang.xyz/images/samplelm.jpg

# the effect size you should provide: loadings, structural coefficients
ly_matrix = matrix(c(
  1,0,0,
  0.8,0,0,
  0.8,0,0,
  0,1,0,
  0,0.8,0,
  0,0.8,0,
  0,0,1,
  0,0,0.8,
  0,0,0.8,
  0,0,0.8
),ncol=3,byr=T)
# the loading matrix
# the first-third column: the loadings for X, M, Y
# if you define the first loading of latent variable as 1, the fixed loading method would be used for model identification. 
# Otherwise, the fixed variance method would be applied.

latentvar = c("X", "M", "Z","Y")
model = '
Y ON X*0.3
	M*0.2
	Z*0.2;
M ON X* 0.3;
XZ | X XWITH Z;
Y ON XZ*0.3;'

analysis = 'Estimator = ML;
	TYPE = RANDOM;
    ALGORITHM = INTEGRATION;'
# TYPE = RANDOM and ALGORITHM = INTEGRATION are necessary settings for latent moderation analysis.
# when the analysis part inclue settings for TYPE, ALGORITHM, INTEGRATION and so on, you need to define the analysis part using Mplus synatx.

samplelm(ly_matrix, latentvar, model, estimator, n0 = 300, analysis)
